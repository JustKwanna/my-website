# Personal Portfolio
It's a website about me.The website contains my resume, projects and other interests.<br />
It has my *Educational background* and my most valuable *Achievements* so far. The website gives an insight to projects that I have done along with my resume and my personal interests too. There is also an abstract information about the *Startup Community* & a *Club* which I am currently a part of in my university.<br />
Users can contact me through the website.<br />
There is also an interesting *blog* about *Anime* which is linked to the first portfolio page. 
# AK Anime Network
The anime blog has it's own logo and different style to represent the beauty of Anime which I have covered. I regularly update the blog once in two months. First of all there is a description about how I got to know about anime and started my **Otaku** life. After that, there is a list of Anime which I have covered in the same order as I saw them. I have given a short description about every single one of them and represented some good scenes with pictures. I also have given my own rating to each one of them and the number of episodes are written at the last of the description.<br />
I will continue to watch new Anime and update them on this blog of mine.:wink:
## Development:
The website has been developed on *HTML5*, *CSS3* and *JavaScript*. A little bit of *PHP* is used to make the contact form.<br />
*Bootstrap* framework is used.
